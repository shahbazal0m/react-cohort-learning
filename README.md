# React Cohort Learning 🚀

This repository contains my **day-wise React learning journey** from the  
**Job Ready AI Powered Live Cohort 1.0** by **Sheryians Coding School**.

I am learning React step by step and pushing my progress regularly to GitHub
to maintain consistency and track my improvement.

---

## 🗓️ Day-wise Progress

- ✅ **Day 1:** Export & Import (default + named exports)
- ✅ **Day 2:** Event Handling (click events, parameterized functions)
- ✅ **Day 3:** Rendering JSON data using `map()`
- ✅ **Day 4:** useState Hook (state management + two-way binding)

- ➡️ More topics will be added as I continue learning.
